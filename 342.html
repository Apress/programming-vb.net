<H3>There is an error in the Threading chapter that survived the first two printings (which is rather embarrassing I must confess
since I say what one needs to do and then don't do it correctly).
It was <it> finally</it> changed in the third printing.</H3>
<p>
On page 420-421 I talk about the importance of using a <b>MethodInvoker</b> to call into GUI thread from outside of it. The problem is I then I didn't write the code that uses
the <b>MethodInvoker</b> method the correct way. You have to call it using the <b>Invoke</b> method of the <b>Control</b> class so please replace this line
on page 421:
</p>
<p><font SIZE  +2><pre>myInvoker.Invoke</pre></font></p>
by
<p><font SIZE  +2><pre>m_Button.Invoke(myInvoker)</pre></font></p>


<H3>These are the errata/changes from the first printing to the second printing. The first group are bugs
or serious typos, the remaining ones are cosmetic improvements or clarifications.
</H3>
<B>p156, first printing:</b> The program on p156 has a bug. (Interestingly enough it is correct in the program that extends this example
on page 366). Oh well. In any case the problem is I neglected to store the value of the
shared instance field m_EmployeeID in an instance field of the individual class.
Here is the correct code with the new/changed lines in bold
</p>
<P>
<pre>
Public Class Employee
    Private m_Name As String
    Private m_Salary As Decimal
    Private Shared m_EmployeeID As Integer = 10000<B>
    Private m_MyID As Integer</b>
    Public Sub New(ByVal thesName As String, ByVal curSalary As Decimal)
       m_Name = thesName
       m_Salary = curSalary
       m_EmployeeID = m_EmployeeID + 1 <B>
       m_MyID = m_EmployeeID</B>
  End Sub
  ReadOnly Property EmployeeId() As Integer<B>
     Get
        Return m_MyID
     End Get</B>
  End Property
  ReadOnly Property TheName() As String
    Get
      TheName = m_Name
    End Get
  End Property
  ReadOnly Property Salary() As Decimal
    Get
      Salary = m_Salary
    End Get
  End Property
End Class
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<B>p224, first printing:</b> In the program on page 224 I neglected to have <B>Option Strict On</B>
so the program as printed will run as is even though there are potentially lossy conversions being made automatically.
This of course is not what I advocate so
strongly so <i>please</i> replace this program with the following <B>Option Strict On</B>
compatible code where the changed lines are in bold:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
Public Class EmbeddedObjects
    Implements ICloneable
    Private m_Data() As String
    Public Sub New(ByVal anArray() As String)
        m_Data = anArray
    End Sub
    Public Function Clone() As Object _
    Implements ICloneable.Clone
        Dim temp() As String<B>
        temp = CType(m_Data.Clone, String()) 'clone the array</B>
        Return New EmbeddedObjects(temp)
    End Function
    Public Sub DisplayData()
        Dim temp As String
        For Each temp In m_Data
            Console.WriteLine(temp)
        Next
    End Sub
    Public Sub ChangeData(ByVal newData As String)
        m_Data(0) = newData
    End Sub
End Class

Page 254: Second paragraph, the text after “Why?” should be deleted and replaced with the following which is much clearer:
“Well, if you want to register a listener with an event source, feed the event source a special kind of delegate. This delegate encapsulates a reference to the listener object and a ‘pointer’ to the method inside the listener object that you want triggered when the event happens. Since the event source will have a delegate inside of it that encapsulates exactly the information  needed to callback the right member in the listener object, the .NET runtime has no problem doing the callback.”
